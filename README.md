# Bellingcat Hackathon - Digital Investigation Tool 2022

This file will include all the information related to Bellingcat Hackathon - Digital Investigation Tool. The main idea will be to build a single tool / network for all researchers.

**This tool will try to solve the following possibilities:**

- Find, collaborate and share work with other researchers easier and faster.
- Possibility to search and share the right tools.
- Raise challenges or questions to speed up and faciliate the research process.
- It will facilitate the learning process for new researchers.
- Will unite researchers into one joint team.

## The Problem

In this section I will try to describe what problems and challenges I have noticed based on a survey from [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/), [These are the Tools Open Source Researchers Say They Need](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/08/12/these-are-the-tools-open-source-researchers-say-they-need), and my personal experience.

### Survey Summary

More than 500 people took the time to answer our questions, telling [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/) about their experiences using (or failing to use) various online tools.

**I came to the following conclusions:**

- **49.7%** of researchers are doing their work during their free time.
- The biggest group **35%** indicated that they still see a need to improve their skills.
- The biggest group **34.7%** reported that they use tools.
- More than **30%** have never used GitHub, **22%** donâ€™t know how to use them, **23.4%** struggled or failed.
- More than **83%** of the survey respondents find it either difficult or time-consuming to find the right tools.

So, what I see is that there is a huge interest in OSINT, many people are interested and ready to do that even during their free time. But at the same time researchers are facing difficulties in learning, finding the right tools, and using these tools. As a result, it may extend the research time, degrade the quality of the research, or even neglect research.

### Personal Experience

Unfortunately, my personal experience is very similar to the survey respondents. I am a software engineer, but sometimes, it is hard to find out and find the right tools and how to use them even for me. At the same time, it is hard to find like-minded people to speed up and facilitate the research process. Also, sometimes it is difficult to find research to contribute to. Therefore, most of the time, even if there is free time and the desire to contribute to the OSINT community, I am unable to do so.

**My personal insights:**

- Engineers have different communities where they can ask for help and help others. For example: [GitHub](https://github.com), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), etc.
- Data scientists have different communities where they can find datasests, learning material, competitions. For example: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), etc.
- OSINT community is very separate and isolated into small groups or sometimes it's just individual people doing their job.

## The Solution

In this section, I will try to provide a solution to the problems I mentioned above. The main idea would be to create a community that would be like a single and universal digital investigation tool for all researchers. This tool could have solve several problems at once.

### Community

Researchers would be able to introduce themselves, highlight their strongest areas, discover and find co-researchers, participate in research challenges, share their tooling or work, build OSINT frameworks, collaborate, or even participate in challenges or competitions. In my opinion, it should be a closed community, maybe Bellingcat or community itself could verify and approve people who want to join. But I am not sure about it, I guess this part should probably be discussed later.

### Tools

Imagine it like a tool database, researchers would be able to add or suggest new tools, add instructions or tutorials on how to use these tools, and search tools not only by category but for example based on the data they have and data they are looking for, vote for their favorite tools, save them, pin to research they share, suggest tools to other researchers or request for tools. Also, there are many more ideas on how the Tools database could be used in the future, for example, people would be able to easily build their OSINT frameworks. Tools could be even integrated using APIs to provide user-friendly UI and easy access for everyone.

### Learning

It would be nice if people would be able to share their knowledge with others, ask for help or write down simple instructions about different methods and techniques on how to solve various problems and find the information researchers are looking for.

### Collaboration

It could be a very simple way of bringing people together or mobilizing the whole community to solve the most important problems. I have got inspired by Kaggle competitions, where people or companies can provide a challenge and different teams or individuals are trying to solve/provide the most efficient ML model within a short period. It could be something just plain fun, like a challenge, for example, finding geolocation as fast and accurate as possible. So, that junior researchers would be able to practice and learn to use various tools. Or it could be even something serious, for example, Bellingcat may ask for community help and teams or individuals would try to do their research and share their discoveries. Based on that, it would be possible to compare efficiency and based on that share the most efficient ways to achieve certain results. Also it would be possible to compare data accuracy, for example if multiple researchers reach the same result.

### TBA

I have more ideas that could be supplemented or added in the future, however, the features described above are the most important in my opinion. This could attract more people and allow them to collaborate and contribute to the OSINT community.
